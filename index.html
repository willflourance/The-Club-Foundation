                <strong>Howdy!</strong>
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">For 2019 World Conference in Nashville, The Club Foundation will be hosting a boot auction! Yes, boots like in cowboy boots! The thinking here is to auction off pairs of cowboy boots and have them available at “buy it now” prices so that members can buy and wear for the networking event and throughout conference. We are asking for your help in making this possible. We’d like to ask each Chapter and each Exhibitor to donate one or more pairs of boots for the auction! The best place to purchase the boots is through Zappos because they have a 365 day return policy. So, for example, if someone buys the boots but the size isn’t right, the winner will have a year to exchange for the correct size. Additionally, Zappos has a tremendous selection in many price points from the uber-luxe Lucchese boots to Roper and Dingo brands, really something for everyone. Check out these two links, the first is men’s boots and the second is ladies.</p>
              <a class="btn btn-primary btn-cta-2 my-2" href="https://www.zappos.com/men-cowboy-boots/CK_XARCz1wEYyewBwAEC4gIEAQIDGA.zso">Men's</a>

            <h5 class="card-title">
              <strong>What size should I buy?</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>The most common boot size for men is 10 ½ and for women it’s 7 ½ -8. My suggestion would be to buy boots in this range but feel free to venture out because with over 2,000 attendees, there are bound to be many different boot sizes at the conference. If the boot does not fit the auction winner, the boots can be easily exchanged by the winner if the boots were purchased at Zappos.

              <strong>Do you have a preference on color, leather, or heel height?</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>No, this is up to you. Buy something that speaks to you. Use your creativity!
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">
              <strong>What do I do with them after I buy them?</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>Please fill out the attached donation <a href="documents/forms/CF_DonationForm2019_01.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>form</strong></a> and send back to me. I will keep track of who donated what and you will receive credit and marketing on the auction app.
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">
              <strong>How much should I spend on the boots?</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>That’s entirely up to you. Please spend generously as that will increase the proceeds from the boot auction. All funds generated from the auction will support The Club Foundation scholarship and grants program. The more you give, the more we can give.
            </p>
            <h5 class="card-title">
              <strong>Are you doing this in lieu of the wine auction or the other Club Foundation auction?</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>No, this will be in addition to and not instead of the wine auction supported by The Club Foundation at World Conference.
